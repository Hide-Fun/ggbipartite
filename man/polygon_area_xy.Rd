\title{Polygon area via the shoelace formula}
\usage{
polygon_area_xy(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame/tibble with numeric columns \code{x} and \code{y} and
at least 3 rows (vertices).}
}
\value{
A non-negative numeric scalar: the polygon area.
}
\description{
Compute the signed area magnitude of a simple (non-self-intersecting) polygon
given its vertices in traversal order. The result is always non-negative.
}
\details{
The area is computed as
\deqn{A = \frac{1}{2}\left|\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1})\right|}
with \eqn{(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1)}.
